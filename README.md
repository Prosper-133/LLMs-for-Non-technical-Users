# 🌺 Botanical Bloom: Organic Beauty Copywriting Assistant

## 🧠 Problem

Small and medium organic skincare brands often struggle to craft **consistent, emotionally resonant, and SEO-rich** copy that reflects their organic values.

It’s a *PartyRock-built LLM assistant* that generates compelling, brand-authentic marketing copy tailored to:

* Product type
